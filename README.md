Below are the changes that were made on Horiseon Marketing's webpage in order to improve it's overall acessibility & organization:

     * Images/img tags were given alt descriptions with enough detail for acessibility tools to use to fully inform viewers,
     
     * Semantic HTML elements were added to specify the function of each parent & sibling element and section of the webpage 
     (this included changing <div> tags to semantic tags like <nav> <aside> etc),
     
     * Other HTML elements were renamed to better reflect their function, such as .hero to .companyphoto
     
     * CSS code was re-organized to match the order of HTML code (like h2 elements coming before h3)
     
     * CSS classes and elements were consolidated by how they shared the same attributes (this also included shortening class 
     titles to share the same CSS block as sibling classes, as seen on lines 89,98,102,119,124,130)
     
     * Some HTML classes were changed to elements to consolidate CSS & increase HTML cleanliness 
     (.content class was changed to content, seen in CSS on line 82)
     
     * HTML head title was renamed to reflect the function of the webpage 
     
     * A flex box property was created and applied to the Header & Nav Bar to increase acessibility
